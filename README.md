First assesment.
created a scale able grid. 
created a simple notes taking app where you can add delete and edit notes, the notes can also we colored by clicking the attached buttons.

for Part3. 
I have changed subheaders to say that the page has been hacked. 
then I changed the footers to be "the page has been derailed."
lastly I made it so that when a button is clicked that buttons color changes to red.
